This is a simple example of a Marketplace Listing Page.

## Configuration
Please make sure you set the NETWORK and MARKETPLACE_LISTING_ID in index.html

## How does it work?
In this example, we are adding a [Connect Widget](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-for-developers/resources/widgets/connect-widget) and a [Marketplace Widget](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-for-developers/resources/widgets/marketplace-widgets) which will display a marketplace listing.
