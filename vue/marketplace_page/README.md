<img src="screenshot.png" width="300" />

This is a simple example of an Marketplace Listing Page.

This was created using the standard create-react-app script.

## Configuration
Please make sure you set the VUE_APP_NETWORK and VUE_APP_MARKETPLACE_LISTING_ID in the .env or your own .env.local.

## How does it work?
In this example, we are adding a [Connect Widget](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-for-developers/resources/widgets/connect-widget) and a [Marketplace Widget](https://docs.manifold.xyz/v/manifold-for-developers/resources/widgets/marketplace-widgets) which will display a marketplace listing.
